# This is documentation for the ForceBalance condensed phase reference data file,,,,,,
"# Lines beginning with octothorpe are comments, empty lines are ignored",,,,,,
"# A line can either be a comment, a global parameter, a single line with column headings, or a data line (after the column heading line)",,,,,,
# This file should be saved as .xlsx (to preserve formatting) but exported to .csv for ForceBalance to use.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"# Global parameters are defined here; they have ""Global"" in the first column.",,,,,,
# rho_denom : least squares denominator for the density objective function,,,,,,
"# Note: w_rho, w_hvap etc. is set in the input file.  This is because it's considered an adjustable option rather than a property of the data set.",,,,,,
# The overall prefactor for an observable is w_obs / obs_denom^2 ,,,,,,

"# Before entering the data, there must be one line with column headings.",,,,,,
# Allowed column headings are: (not case sensitive),,,,,,
# T : Temperature in Kelvin,,,,,,
"# P : Pressure in specified unit (append atm or bar), default is atm",,,,,,
# Rho : Density in kg m^-3,,,,,,
